# ResKG
## Abstract 
With the proliferation of heterogeneous entities and complex interactions in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, reasoning over incomplete structured knowledge has become a critical challenge. Consequently, Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has attracted significant attention as a fundamental solution for inferring missing elements and refining these knowledge structures. Despite significant progress, knowledge graph completion still encounters structural challenges, particularly when reasoning over complex multi-hop relations and many-to-many relational patterns. To address these issues, we propose ResKG, a resonant framework that enhances link prediction by leveraging structural resonance across isomorphic subgraphs. Two key insights motivate our design: 1) local subgraphs with similar topological configurations often exhibit consistent structural patterns; and 2) neighboring entities contribute unevenly to relation inference depending on their structural salience. Building on these observations, ResKG introduces two modules: 1) Topology-Aware Dependency, which captures structural consistency across isomorphic subgraphs, and 2) Resonance Relationship Mining, which adaptively emphasizes structurally informative neighbors through a resonant bias mechanism. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that ResKG achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction, highlighting the importance of structural resonance modeling for knowledge graph completion. Our work provides new insights into structural property modeling for KGC, and the code of ResKG will be released later.
